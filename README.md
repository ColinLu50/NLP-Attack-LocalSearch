# Efficient Combinatorial Optimization for Adversarial Textual Attack

This repository contains source code for the research work described in our TASL paper:
[Efficient Combinatorial Optimization for Adversarial Textual Attack](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9627642?casa_token=6RrgzJlGKSQAAAAA:8Z1lr8reJuClOQlo2SlI0uBHK9D1sUriklHSi9f9-sVZ_Lvb6KYTC7zVldlw2mlJeKYIf0ms)

## Attacking
The folders *GA_related*, *PSO_related*, *SbGS_related* and *SGS_related* all contain a *readme* file, which is a step-by-step instruction to obtain the dataset and victim model, run LS and the baseline algorithm, and gather results under the corresponding attack scenarios.
