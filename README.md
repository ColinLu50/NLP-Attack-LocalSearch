# Efficient Combinatorial Optimization for Adversarial Textual Attack

This repository contains source code for the research work described in our ALC 2021 findings paper:
[Efficient Combinatorial Optimization for Adversarial Textual Attack](url)

## Attacking
The folders *GA_related*, *PSO_related*, *SbGS_related* and *SGS_related* all contain a *readme* file, which is a step-by-step instruction to obtain the dataset and victim model, run LS and the baseline algorithm, and gather results under the corresponding attack scenarios.
